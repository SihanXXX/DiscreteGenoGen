# Phenotype Prediction from Genotype Data

This repository contains simple implementations of **XGBoost** and **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** models to predict **phenotypes** from **genotype** data. The goal is to evaluate how well synthetic genotype data can achieve comparable performance AS real genotype data. The repository leverages the **Optuna** library for hyperparameter optimization.

## Repository Structure

- `xgboost.py`: Implementation of the **XGBoost** model for phenotype prediction.
- `mlp.py`: Implementation of the **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** model for phenotype prediction.

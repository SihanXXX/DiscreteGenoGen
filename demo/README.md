# Demo: Generating Synthetic Genotype Data Using Pretrained Models and Computing Evaluation Metrics

This repository provides simple and easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks that demonstrates how users can:

- **Load a trained model** from the [models](../models) repository.
- **Generate synthetic genotype data** using the loaded model.
- **Evaluate the synthetic data** by computing evaluation metrics from the [metric](../metric) repository.

This demo is designed to help users partially reproduce the results of our experiments.
